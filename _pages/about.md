<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a first-year PhD student from the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiaotong University. I received my Master's degree from Nankai University and my Bachelor's degree from Xidian University in 2017 and 2021, respectively. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Wei Shen**](https://shenwei1231.github.io/).

My research interests lie in the fields of computer vision and deep learning, with a particular focus on image-text multi-modal learning, semantic segmentation, and label distribution learning. I am driven by the challenge of creating models that can understand and generate meaningful representations from complex, multi-modal scenes. Please feel free to contact me through email: changsong@sjtu.edu.cn.
